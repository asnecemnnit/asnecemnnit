Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate Engineer with a strong evolving interest in Computer-Vision and Deep-Learning. Here you'll find some of my projects and contributions.

## About Me üßë‚Äçüíª

I am pursuing M.Sc. in Information Technology with a specialization in Embedded Systems Engineering and a strong focus in the area of Artificial Intelligence. I have 3+ years of full-time experience working as a Software Developer in the Automotive Industry, and a 6-months internship in Embedded-AI domain. Currently, I am working (as a master's thesis student) on vehicle/light-source detection & classification (night-time without sufficient light from other sources) using Computer-Vision and Deep-Learning. I have a knack for approaching and solving real-world challenges using critical-thinking.

## Projects üöÄ

Here are a few projects I've been working on:

- **[Billiards Motion Prediction](https://github.com/asnecemnnit/fapra_ai_public):** Predicting motion of billiard balls using neural network models (Universit√§t Stuttgart).
- **[AI or Not](https://github.com/asnecemnnit/huggingface_competitions_aiornot):** In this competition, my task was to build a neural network model that can identify AI-generated images.
- **[Ship-Detection](https://github.com/asnecemnnit/huggingface_competitions_shipdetection):** In this competition, my goal was to use satellite imagery to detect ships in ports.
