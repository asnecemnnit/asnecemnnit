Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate Engineer with a strong evolving interest in Computer-Vision and Deep-Learning. Here you'll find some of my projects and contributions.

## About Me üßë‚Äçüíª

Currently working as a Deep Learning Engineer at **[SiMa.ai](https://sima.ai/)**.

**Background:**

M.Sc. graduate in Information Technology, with specialization in Embedded Systems and Artificial Intelligence. Over three years of experience in the Automotive Industry as a Software Developer, and an internship in Embedded-AI. For my masters thesis, I worked on the development of nighttime vehicle detection methods using Computer Vision and Deep Learning. Skilled in applying critical thinking to real-world challenges. 

## Projects üöÄ

Here are a few projects (and competitions) I've been involved in:

- **[Billiards Motion Prediction](https://github.com/asnecemnnit/fapra_ai_public):** Predicting motion of billiard balls using neural network models (Universit√§t Stuttgart).
- **[AI or Not](https://github.com/asnecemnnit/huggingface_competitions_aiornot):** In this competition, my task was to build a neural network model that can identify AI-generated images.
- **[Ship-Detection](https://github.com/asnecemnnit/huggingface_competitions_shipdetection):** In this competition, my goal was to use satellite imagery to detect ships in ports.
